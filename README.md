### How much time did you spend on this test?
3 hours

### Can you explain the technical choice you made for the CSS and JavaScript?
For this test I used create-react-app and scss for the style. For me it is the simplest way to start a react project.
I organised my code in different folders :
- pages : all the pages
- style : all our style organised with style for our pages and utils (where your can find our style variables)

### If you had more time to spend on the test, what would you like to add to your solution?
So many things !
- Protect my ranking page route (I got a bit lost with the evolution of react-router-dom v6 evolution)
- Improve the login page style so that it looks like the design and add responsive breakpoints.
- Finish the ranking page
